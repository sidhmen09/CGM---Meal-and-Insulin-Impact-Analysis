# CGM - Meal and Insulin Impact Analysis
One of the most valuable insights for users is understanding how meals and insulin timing influence postprandial (after-meal) glucose spikes. This project simulates a real analytics use case by transforming CGM data into actionable, interpretable insights.

## Problem Statement
Analyze how meal intake and insulin dosage impact postprandial glucose response and build predictive models to estimate: 
- Glucose spike magnitude
- Time-to-peak glucose after meals

## Models, Tools & Librabries
- Python Libraries - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Seaborn
- Models used -   Linear Regression, Random forest, Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Evaluation Metrics - Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean squared Error (RMSE), R-squared
  
## Data Overview
- Total CGM readings - 100,800
- Number of Patients - 25
- Monitoring duration - 14 days per patient
- Total meal events - 2972
- Data collection period - 01-01-2024 to 14-01-2024
