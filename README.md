# CGM - Meal and Insulin Impact Analysis
One of the most valuable insights for users is understanding how meals and insulin timing influence postprandial (after-meal) glucose spikes. This project simulates a real analytics use case by transforming CGM data into actionable, interpretable insights.

## Problem Statement
Analyze how meal intake and insulin dosage impact postprandial glucose response and build predictive
models to estimate: - Glucose spike magnitude - Time-to-peak glucose after meals

## Tools & Librabries used
Python Libraries - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
  

## Exploratory Data Analysis
